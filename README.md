# discord_board_game_setup
This is a tool to help people organize an upcoming board game session.  It is *not* for actually playing the game.
Progressing through the bot prompts, users create 'profiles' for games that can be saved and retrieved for reuse.
Current game profile parameters include:
  - Min - Max Player Counts
  - Roles (not to be confused with Discord roles, eg Captain, Radio Operator, etc in 'Captain Sonar')
  - Teams

The bot facilitates a roster of players sourced from the Discord server and also allows for players to be written in.
This roster can be randomly or manually distributed across roles/teams.

The bot also includes easter egg homage to Tim and Eric's Celery Man.

This project began this week (11/9/21) and is still very much in development!
